# sdaIbanCheck
Contains one docker-compose.yml file, and two microservice java projects that comunicate with each other through Kafka topics.  Run the project:  Install / open docker 1 -  docker-compose up ( use "docker-compose up -d" if you want to use detached mode and hide the console logs ) 2 - start the sdaPdfNotif spring cloud stream project.      - you can use any java code editor to open the project and run it (I used inteliJ for debugging ) or you can:         2.1     -      cd sdaPdfNotif          2.2     -      ./mvnw package spring-boot:run -DskipTests=true -Pkafka 3 - go to pdfChecker directory     - you can use any java code editor to open the project and run it (I used inteliJ for debugging ) or you can:         3.1     -      cd sdaPdfNotif          3.2     -      ./mvnw package spring-boot:run -DskipTests=true -Pkafka  Further development.  Use Kafka connect with spool dir plugin to monitor a directory for when a pdf file apears, and then send the file information to a kafka topic. Write tests. Provide blacklisted ibans in another way, maybe DB, maybe api request. Add apache license.
